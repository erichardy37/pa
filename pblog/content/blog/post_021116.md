Summary: A brief overview of Stata's basic functionality

Two of the main challenges when learning a new programming language are to get a sense for what can be done, and to find idiomatic ways to construct programs.
This tutorial contains a brief overview of common data manipulation and analysis techniques in Stata.  None of the material is exhaustive; more detailed tutorials on each topic are to come.  

This tutorial is an executable stata "do-file".  Download the three files below into the same folder on your computer, and run commands from the .do file to view their output and how they change the dataset.
