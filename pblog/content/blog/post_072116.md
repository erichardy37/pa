Summary: A brief overview of R's basic functionality

Two of the main challenges when learning a new programming language are to get a sense for what can be done, and to find idiomatic ways to construct programs.
This tutorial contains a brief overview of common data manipulation and analysis techniques in R.  None of the material is exhaustive; more detailed tutorials on each topic are to come.  

This tutorial is an executable R file.  Download the file below into any folder on your computer.  If you have not yet installed R, it can be downloaded for free from [www.r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org/); Rstudio is also free and can be downloaded from [www.rstudio.com](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download2/).

# R Tutorial

This tutorial provides an overview of basic data manipulation in R

Advanced R by Hadley Wickham is a great resource
[http://adv-r.had.co.nz/](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/)
For all the gory details, see the R language definition:
[https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-lang.pdf](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-lang.pdf)

#### Use R for:
- data manipulation
- data analysis
- graphing
- tables out to excel or latex
- web scraping/apis

#### In this tutorial:
- import data (package 'foreign')
- browse dataset (subset, head, View, str()) 
- create new variables 
- explore data
- functions and apply statements
- dplyr: pipes, merge/append, grouped operations, etc.
- regression
- tables to latex
- graphing: ggplot2

#### Properties of R
- "functional" programming language: ideally little or no "state", vectorized code
- there are many ways to do the same thing; this makes R flexible but difficult to learn
- the period "." is not an operator, and is often used in object names.  ex: data.frame

#### Finding help
- if you know the command name, type "?command.name" at the R prompt
- if you know the approximate command name, type "?approximate.command.name" at the R prompt
- when using google, include "+R" in your search query to return results containing the string "R"
- ex: viewing documentation for the 'tidyr' package, which can be used to reshape datasets
- google: "+R CRAN tidyr"; click the first link: "CRAN - Package tidyr" for the package overview
- "Reference manual: tidyr.pdf" includes descriptions for all commands in the package
- "Vignettes: Tidy data" providex examples of how to use the package

#### Installing packages
- to install, type install.packages('package.name') at the R prompt ">"
- ex: install.packages('dplyr')
- once installed, these packages can be loaded by typing "require('package.name')"
- ex: require('dplyr')

#### Miscellaneous
- There are no block comments in R.  
- Highlight a block of code and press "control-shift-c" to comment out the whole thing
- in Rstudio, run a block of code by highlighting it and pressing Cmd-Return (Mac) or Ctrl-Return (Windows and Linux) 
- in Rstudio, to run the entire program, press Cmd-Shift-Return (Mac) or Ctrl-Shift-Return (Windows and Linux)

#### Editorializing
- give your saved datasets the same name as the R file that created them
- if you are using lots of loops, you are doing something wrong
- keep variable names short and informative
- when creating new variables, indicate relationships to other variables with names
- ex: the variable "height.max" could store the maximum value of "height"



### Basics

Remove all datasets, functions, etc. from R session memory
```r
rm(list=ls())
```
to install packages, type at the R prompt:
```r
install.packages('case.sensitive.package.name')
```

load any required packages 
if they are not installed, download them using `install.packages()`
```r
require(dplyr)
require(tidyr)
require(ggplot2)
require(stargazer)
```
To view the working directory
```r
getwd() 
# [1] "/your/file/path/here"
```
To change working directory 
```r
setwd('~/your/file/path/here')
```

A vector is an array of elements that are all the same class 
(eg numeric, string, logical)
Create a vector, `v`
```r
v <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
class(v)
# [1] "integer"
```
View v, the first element of v, and the first three elements of v
Multiple commands on the same line can be separated by a semicolon
```r
v; v[1]; v[1:3]
# [1] 1 2 3 4 5
# [1] 1
# [1] 1 2 3
```
Operations are performed on every element of the vector
```r
v + 5; v > 2; v %in% c(1,3)
# [1] 6 7 8 9 10
# [1] FALSE FALSE TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
# [1]  TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE
```
Operations on a single element can be performed as well
```r
v[1] <- v[1] + 5
v
# [1] 6 2 3 4 5
```
An equivalent way to define `v`
```r
v <- 1:5
```
Create a vector of 10 zeros:
```r
v.a <- rep(0, 10)
```
Concatenate v and v.a
Objects of the same type can be concatenated with the c() command.  Notice that v was originally defined this way.
```r
v.concatenated <- c(v, v.a) 
v.concatenated
# 1 2 3 4 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
```
Objects of different types can be combined as a list
In this case, a numeric vector, a string vector, and a logical type
```r
list.a <- list(v, c('stuff', 'and', 'nonsense'), TRUE)
```
Notice that list.a[2] returns a list, whereas list.a[[2]] returns the contents of the 2nd element (a vector)
```r
list.a; list.a[2]; list.a[[2]]; list.a[[2]][3]
# [[1]]
# [1] 1 2 3 4 5 
# 
# [[2]]
# [1] "stuff"    "and"      "nonsense" 
# 
# [[3]]
# [1] TRUE

list.a[2]; list.a[[2]]; list.a[[2]][3]
# [[1]]
# [1] "stuff"    "and"      "nonsense"
 
list.a[[2]]; list.a[[2]][3]
# [1] "stuff"    "and"      "nonsense"

list.a[[2]][3]
# [1] "nonsense"
```
View the "structure" of the object
```r
str(list.a)
# List of 3
#  $ : int [1:5] 1 2 3 4 5
#  $ : chr [1:3] "stuff" "and" "nonsense"
#  $ : logi TRUE
```
Create another list
```r
list.b <- list(c('other stuff'), FALSE)
```
Make a list of lists
```r
list.c <- list(list.a, list.b)
```
Concatenate the two lists into a third list
```r
list.d <- c(list.a, list.b)
str(list.c)
# List of 2
#  $ :List of 3
#   ..$ : int [1:5] 1 2 3 4 5
#   ..$ : chr [1:3] "stuff" "and" "nonsense"
#   ..$ : logi TRUE
#  $ :List of 2
#   ..$ : chr "other stuff"
#   ..$ : logi FALSE

str(list.d)
# List of 5
#  $ : int [1:5] 1 2 3 4 5
#  $ : chr [1:3] "stuff" "and" "nonsense"
#  $ : logi TRUE
#  $ : chr "other stuff"
#  $ : logi FALSE
```
Regular expressions are for pattern matching in strings
Regular expressions are an extensive topic in their own right
Cheat sheet: [http://web.mit.edu/hackl/www/lab/turkshop/slides/regex-cheatsheet.pdf](http://web.mit.edu/hackl/www/lab/turkshop/slides/regex-cheatsheet.pdf)
Examples in R: [http://stat545.com/block022_regular-expression.html](http://stat545.com/block022_regular-expression.html)
```r
animal.names <- c('ant', 'bear', 'cat', 'dog', 'deer')
```
Return all animal names that begin with the letter 'd'
```r
grep('^d', animal.names, value=TRUE)
# [1] "dog"  "deer"
```
Return a vector indicating whether the animal name ends with the letter 't'
```r
grepl('t$', animal.names)
# [1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE
```
# return all animal names that contain a or e
```r
grep('a|e', animal.names, value=TRUE)
# [1] "ant"  "bear" "cat"  "deer"
```
"apply" statements apply a function to each element of a vector or list, and return a vector or list of results
sapply returns a vector; lapply returns a list
apply statements should be used rather than for loops.

Test whether each element in a list is a logical type
```r
is.logical(TRUE); is.logical('string')
# [1] TRUE
# [1] FALSE
sapply(list.d, is.logical)
# [1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE
```

### Data Frames

In this tutorial we will create data rather than import it
See `?read.table` for commands to importing text files, including `.csv` files
The `foreign` package enables R to import data from Stata (`.dta`), SAS (`.sas7bdat`), and SPSS (`.sav`), among others
[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/foreign/foreign.pdf](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/foreign/foreign.pdf)

A data.frame is the object in which to store a dataset.
A data.frame is a set of columns of equal length, which are all vectors
Columns can have different types, but as vectors, all elements in a column must have the same type
Create toy data.frames
```r
d <- data.frame(group=c('a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'c'),
                age=c(5, 7, 6, 8, 9, 10, 13, 60, 49),
                gender=c('male', 'male', 'male', 'female', 'female', 'female', 'female', 'male', NA),
                stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

d.group.d <- data.frame(group=c('d', 'd', 'd', 'd'),
                        age=c(35, 29, 32, 40),
                        gender=c('male', 'male', 'female', 'female'),
                        stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

d.color <- data.frame(group=c('a', 'a', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'c', 'd'),
                      gender=c('male', 'female', 'male', 'female', 'male', 'female', 'male'),
                      color=c('blue', 'pink', 'blue', 'pink', 'blue', 'pink', 'blue'),
                      stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
```

A `factor` variable in R is an encoding for a string variable. 
In the gender variable, R will no longer remember 9 strings of `male` or `female`
Instead it will have two strings `male` and `female`, and associate these with factors `1` and `2`.  
This can save memory, but the datasets in this tutorial are too small to bother

View the dataset
```r
d
#    group age gender
#	1     a   5   male
#	2     a   7   male
#	3     a   6   male
#	4     a   8 female
#	5     b   9 female
#	6     b  10 female
#	7     b  13 female
#	8     c  60   male
#	9     c  49   <NA>
```
View the first 6 (by default) rows of the dataset
```r
head(d)
#    group age gender
#	1     a   5   male
#	2     a   7   male
#	3     a   6   male
#	4     a   8 female
#	5     b   9 female
#	6     b  10 female
```
View the first two rows of the dataset
```r
head(d, 2)
#    group age gender
#	1     a   5   male
#	2     a   7   male
```
Equivalently
```r
d[1:2, ]
#    group age gender
#	1     a   5   male
#	2     a   7   male
```
Create a new variable, in this case an index of row numbers
```r
d$index <- 1:nrow(d)
```
Equivalently
```r
d['index'] <- 1:nrow(d)
```
Remove the index variable
```r
d$index <- NULL
```
View variable names in d
```r
names(d)
```
As before, operations are performed on every element in a vector
```r
d$age > 8
```
Test for missing values
```r
is.na(d$gender)
any(is.na(d$age))

# view a subset of the rows
d[d$age > 8 & d$gender == 'female', ]
# view a subset of the columns
d[, c('group', 'age')]
# view a subset of rows and a subset of columns
d[d$gender=='female', c('group', 'age')]

# append the observations for group d to the 'd' data.frame
# this 'base R' rbind() command will only work on data.frames with the same number of columns.
# this can be done efficiently and flexibly for large datasets using bind_rows() from dplyr
d <- rbind(d, d.group.d)

# merge the 'color' variable onto data for the four groups
# this can be done efficiently using sql merging concepts with the 'join' commands from dplyr
# in merge syntax, 'd' is the 'x' dataset; 'd.color' is the 'y' dataset
# by default, only elements appearing in both datasets would be kept in the merged dataset
# indicating all.x=TRUE puts all elements originally in 'd' into the merged dataset
d <- merge(d, d.color, by=c('group', 'gender'), all.x=TRUE)


# view the number of observations by characteristic
table(d$group)
table(d$group, d$gender)
# specify the object (d) you are working with once
with(d, table(group, gender))
# re-create the table on a subset of the data
with(d[d$age >=7, ], table(group, gender))
# check for missing values
table(d$group, d$gender, useNA=c('ifany'))

# save the frequency data from the table as a data.frame
d.table <- as.data.frame(table(d$group, d$gender, useNA=c('ifany')), stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
d.table
# rename columns in d.table
names(d.table) <- c('group', 'gender', 'freq')
# 'reshape' the data back to the format seen in the onscreen table with spread() from tidyr
d.table.spread <- spread(d.table, gender, freq)
d.table.spread


# create a variable conditional on the values of other variables
d$young.male <- ifelse(d$age < 10 & d$gender=='male', 'young.male', 'not.young.male')

# to create a dummy variable for each category in 'group':
# first, select unique elements in d$group
cols <- unique(d$group)
# second, assign 
d[paste0('dummy.', cols)] <- lapply(cols, function(col) as.numeric(d$group==col))

# to refer only to dummy variables
d[, grep('dummy.', names(d))]

# apply function to all dummy variables
dummy <- grep('dummy.', names(d), value=TRUE)
dummy.2 <- paste0(dummy, '.2')

# multiply all existing dummy variables by 2
# notice that the function of multiplying by 2 is implicitly defined in the apply statement
d[dummy.2] <- lapply(d[, dummy], function(x) 2*x)

# larger and reusable functions can be defined on their own
# this function adds 'white noise' to every element in a vector
jiggle <- function(x) {
	x.jiggle <- sapply(x, function(y) y + rnorm(1, sd=.1))
	return(x.jiggle)
}

dummy.jiggle <- paste0(dummy, '.jiggle')

# create jiggled dummy variables, 
d[dummy.jiggle] <- lapply(d[, dummy.2], jiggle)
# equivalently
d[dummy.jiggle] <- lapply(d[, dummy.2], function(x) sapply(x, function(y) y + rnorm(1, sd=.1)))

# delete all 'jiggle' dummy variables
# '.' is a special regex character; \\. tells the regex engine to match a text '.'
d[, grep('\\.jiggle$', names(d))] <- NULL
# delete all '.2$' dummy variables, and 'young.male'
d[, grep('2$', names(d))] <- NULL
d$young.male <- NULL

##########
# dplyr

# dplyr is a package used to perform advanced data manipulation on data.frame like objects.
# dplyr contains many functions that take a data.frame as input, and return a data.frame as output
# dplyr cheat sheet: https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf

# a functional programming language needs a clean way to compose functions
# writing compositions of the form g(f(x)) gets messy with multiple functions and parameters
# functional programs can easily begin to look like this: h(g(f(w), x), y, z)
# introducing pipes (%>% in R) enables cleaner composition of functions
# "x %>% f(y)" is equivalent to "f(x, y)"
# with pipes, h(g(f(w), x), y, z) becomes w %>% f(.,) %>% g(., x) %>% h(., y, z)
# ".," can be explicitly included to indicate which argument is being piped in to the function.

# use dplyr to find:
# 1. the age of the oldest person in each group, 
# 2. the number of people in each group
# 3. rank people in each group by age
d.ranks <- d %>%
	group_by(group) %>%
	mutate(age.max = max(age),
				 num.people = n(),
				 age.rank=dense_rank(-age))

# find the second oldest person in each group
# notice that d.ranks retains its group_by() attributes from above
# there is no need to run group_by() again
d.ranks <- d.ranks %>%
mutate(age.2ndoldest = max(ifelse(age.rank==(num.people-1), age, 0)))

# notice that d.ranks has inherited characteristics of a data.frame, but now has more 
# to group by multiple groups (group and gender, for example), type "group_by(group, gender)"
d.ranks
str(d.ranks)

# regression

# stargazer is a package that formats regression output as a latex table
# the content of the regressions will make no sense; they are simply to demonstrate syntax
# note that string variables should be converted into factors before being used in a regression formula
# a:b denotes an interaction of a and b
cols <- c('group', 'gender')
d[paste0(cols, '.')] <- lapply(d[cols], factor)

reg.d <- lm(age ~ group. + gender. + group.:gender., data=d)
