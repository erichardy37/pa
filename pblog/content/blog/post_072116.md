Summary: A brief overview of R's basic functionality

Two of the main challenges when learning a new programming language are to get a sense for what can be done, and to find idiomatic ways to construct programs.
This tutorial contains a brief overview of common data manipulation and analysis techniques in R.  None of the material is exhaustive; more detailed tutorials on each topic are to come.  

This tutorial is an executable R file.  Download the file below into any folder on your computer.
